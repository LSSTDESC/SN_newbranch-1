Questions that still need consideration:

* Should Firecrown retain the ability to call CCL from calculator mode? Note
  we can also call CCL to call CAMB for the user (rather than the user calling
  CAMB, and giving to CCL the necessary inputs). Our design for the framework
  connectors will use only the calculator mode.
