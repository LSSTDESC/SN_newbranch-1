; Parameters and data in CosmoSIS are organized into sections
; so we can easily see what they mean.
; There is only one section in this case, called cosmological_parameters
[cosmological_parameters]

; These are the only parameters being varied.
omega_m = 0.1 0.3 0.5
h0 = 0.0 0.72 0.9
omega_b = 0.03 0.04 0.07

; The following parameters are set, but not varied.
tau = 0.08
n_s = 0.96
A_s = 2.1e-9
